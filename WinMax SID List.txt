This document contains the source identifier (SID) names that can be accessed from the WinMax control.

--------

SIDs stored as DOUBLE data types

Use the client's GetDoubleSID() function to read these values.  GetIntSID() will not work.
Alternatively, use GetSID() to read the value in string form, then parse to a double or integer as needed.


Cycle Status:

SID_RT_PROGRAM_RUNNING (Read-only)    
Valid Values:
0 = no part program is running
1 = part program is running 

SID_RT_ALL_MOTION_STOPPED  (Read-only)
Valid Values:
0 = one or more axes are moving
1 = all axes are not moving

Alarm Status:
This data exists but is not centralized in the system and therefore can’t be reported through a SID at this time

Alarm Codes:
This data exists but is not centralized in the system and therefore can’t be reported through a SID at this time

Part Counter:

SID_RT_PART_COUNT (Read/Write)

Running Program Information:

SID_WINMAX_RUN_PROGRAM_BLOCK_NUMBER (read-only)


Spindle Load:

Not all machines report a spindle load, but if it exists it can be accessed through the SID below
SID_RT_SPINDLE_LOAD

Comments:
This data does not exist in the system

Control Power:
SID_RT_EMERGENCY_STOP
SID_RT_CONROL_POWER
SID_RT_SERVO_POWER         

Spindle:
SID_RT_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE_PERCENTAGE
SID_RT_SPINDLE_TOOL_RPM

Feedrate:
SID_RT_FEEDRATE_OVERRIDE_PERCENTAGE
SID_RT_VECTOR_FEEDRATE

Rapid:
SID_RT_RAPID_OVERRIDE_PERCENTAGE



Status SIDs

SID_CURRENT_PROGRAM_STATUS (read only)
valid values:
0 = not initialized / reset (state before run)
1 = running
2 = completed successfully
3 = completed with a program error
4 = aborted by user

SID_RT_ALL_MODE_JOG_ENABLE 
Valid Values:	
0 = Jogging can only occur during manual and manual setup modes
1 = Jogging can occur in any machine mode
(Refer to SID_WINMAX_MACHINE_MODE_CHANGED for valid values for the current machine mode.)


SID_RT_CALIBRATED
Valid Values:
0 = not calibrated
1 = calibrated

SID_RT_ACTIVE_PALLET_NUMBER


Axes positions and offsets
DRO machine positions (Machine, Part, Workpiece/Transform Plane, Distance to go)

Warning:  These SIDs are updated frequently while the machine is in motion.  Attempting to retrieve this data frequently is likely to significantly hinder responsiveness of the control.

-------

SIDs stored as INTEGER data types

Use the client's GetIntSID() function to read these values.  GetDoubleSID() will not work.
Alternatively, use GetSID() to get the integer value in string form, then parse it to an integer as needed.

Valid Values:	
0 = Diagnostic Mode                          
1 = Idle Mode                          
2 = Manual Mode                        
3 = Manual Setup Mode
4 = Auto Prep Mode
5 = Auto Run Mode
6 = Interrupt Cycle Mode


-----

SIDs stored as STRING data types

Use the client's GetSID() function to read these values.
